# Baby Steps Item Blinker

Stupid simple MelonLoader mod to add the same LED blinker that the Pedometer has to all objects after you pick them up once.

Requested by cait001 on the Baby Steps Discord server.

To install the mod, first install MelonLoader Nightly onto Baby Steps.

Then, simply drag the .dll file from the Releases tab of the GitHub repo into the "Mods" folder and start up your game.


There is no toggle for it in game, to stop it just remove the mod from your "Mods" folder.

Objects stop blinking after you restart the game.
